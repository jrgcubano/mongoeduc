# Homework 2.2

Add a new product to the products collection of this form:
{
	"_id" : "ac9",
	"name" : "AC9 Phone",
	"brand" : "ACME",
	"type" : "phone",
	"price" : 333,
	"warranty_years" : 0.25,
	"available" : true
}
Note: in general because of the automatic line continuation in the shell, you can cut/paste in the above and shouldn't have to type it all out. Just enclose it in the proper statement(s) to get it added. Next, load into a shell variable the object corresponding to
_id : ObjectId("507d95d5719dbef170f15c00")
Then change term_years to 3 for that document. (And save that to the database.)
Then change over_rate for sms in limits to 0.01 from 0. Save that too.
At the shell prompt type:
homework.b()
