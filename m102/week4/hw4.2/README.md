# Homework 4.2

Now convert the mongod instance (the one in the problem 4.1 above, which uses “--dbpath 1”) to a single server replica set. To do this, you’ll need to stop the mongod and restart it with “--replSet” on its command line. Give the set any name you like. 
Then go to the mongo shell. You should see some data in the week4 database. You can confirm with:
> use week4
> db.foo.find()
Once done with that run
 > homework.b()
in the mongo shell and enter that result.
