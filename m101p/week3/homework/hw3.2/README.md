# Homework 3.2

Making your blog accept posts
In this homework you will be enhancing the blog project to insert entries into the posts collection. After this, the blog will work. It will allow you to add blog posts with a title, body and tags and have it be added to the posts collection properly.

We have provided the code that creates users and allows you to login (the assignment from last week). To get started, please download hw3-2and3-3.tar or hw3-2and3-3.zip and unpack. You will be using these file for this homework and the HW 3.3.

The areas where you need to add code are marked with XXX. You need only touch the BlogPostDAO.py file. There are three locations for you to add code for this problem. Scan that file for XXX to see where to work.

As a reminder, to run your blog you type
python blog.py
To play with the blog you can navigate to the following URLs
http://localhost:8082/
http://localhost:8082/signup
http://localhost:8082/login
http://localhost:8082/newpost
You will be proving that it works by running our validation script as follows: 
python validate.py
You need to run this in a separate terminal window while your blog is running and while the database is running. It makes connections to both to determine if your program works properly. Validate connects to localhost:8082 and expects that mongod is running on localhost on port 27017.

As before, validate will take some optional arguments if you want to run mongod on a different host or a use an external webserver.

This project requires Python 2.7. The code is not 3.0 compliant.

Ok, once you get the blog posts working, validate.py will print out a validation code for HW 3.2. 

Please enter it below, exactly as shown with no spaces.
